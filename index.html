<h3>Detail</h3>
Studied electrical and electronic engineering for 5 years at a Japanese technical college. I was shocked by the high level of graduate students other than myself at the internship I did when I was in the 4th grade, and decided to go abroad (internship students other than myself are graduate students). He had a dog when he was in Japan, but since he came to Australia he has four cats. He loves Japanese anime and has watched over 500 works so far.
