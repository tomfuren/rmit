<h3>Detail</h3>
Studied electrical and electronic engineering for 5 years at a Japanese technical college. I was shocked by the high level of graduate students other than myself at the internship I did when I was in the 4th grade, and decided to go abroad (internship students other than myself are graduate students). He had a dog when he was in Japan, but since he came to Australia he has four cats. He loves Japanese anime and has watched over 500 works so far.
<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
After studying as one of the classes at a college of technology, my interest in IT began. I am interested in IT services that are closely related to people's lives.

After graduating from technical college, the web site I created gets more than 300,000 PV every month and is profitable by affiliates and Google Adsense.
<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
My excellent Chinese friends attended RMIT, so I became interested in RMIT University and decided to enrol.
<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
Regarding IT, I think I’ll able to learn about future perspectives and future prospects from overseas universities, as well as programming skill that will be developed. Also, as an international student, doing one task with local people is a valuable experience, so I believe that I’ll able to learn how to deal with problems with people of various nationalities.<span class="s2">

<br>・Through the test, I can objectively analyse my own personality and way of thinking. Based on the diagnosis results, it will be an opportunity to find out my role in the group, the learning method, and how to overcome my problem. That test will give me various advice according to my personality, so I'm able to work efficiently on my goals.

From the results of this personalities test, I was introverted, but it was written that I was suitable for programmers and engineers because of my curiosity and practical ability are high. (Yes! This is the profession I want to get in the future)

・In general, the diagnostic results are not all, but the test results tell me what role I should do when working within the team. In my case, it was written as this quiet and unobtrusive personality type. In fact, I haven't been able to actively express opinions in school group work so far. However, I am good at guiding team members fairly from fairness, rationalism, and comfort, and having the ability to properly arrange all tasks in view, so I work as an auxiliary supporter for the team. So I can lead my team in a better way. Finally, each team member can work efficiently by performing a role that suits his or her personality.

・If organise a team based on the diagnosis results, I believe that should consider incorporating members of various personalities into one team instead of consolidating one similar personality. If you collect members with only one personality, some members will play the same role, and sometimes the team will fall apart. You also need to look at your personality when forming a team. Some people have different personalities and some do not, so you can avoid teaming up with people who don't. In my case, I have an introverted personality, so I think it's important to work with leaders who actively lead the team and members who understand the introverted personality.
<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
My project is a web service that targets people from three countries, especially Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, and can buy and sell things that they no longer need. The products used in the daily lives of people in those three countries are very similar, and the style of buying and selling second-hand goods is also similar, so we can easily trade what we no longer need. The supported languages displayed will change according to each user, and a chat function will be provided so that negotiations such as the price of second-hand goods can be completed within the service. In addition to the usual second-hand sales, this service also supports product exchanges between users.
<h3>Motivation</h3>
In recent years, the number of Asians migrating to Australia, studying abroad, and working holidays has increased rapidly. Statistics from 2011 to 2020 show that 66,756 Chinese immigrated to Melbourne. There will be more than 260,000 Chinese students in 2019. More than 10,000 people from both Korea and Japan use working holiday visas every year.

Products that East Asians often use in their daily lives are hard to come by in Australian stores. Therefore, many people buy and sell second-hand goods using group talk of chat apps such as WeChat, LINE, and cacao talk. There are many such groups in Melbourne (Australia). Most East Asians don't use Gumtree or eBay often.

This service allows you to carry out Used sale that has been made with conventional chat apps through web services. Having one service makes it easier for users to find second-hand goods and makes it easier to get what they want. Second-hand sellers can promote their products to more users.
<h3>Description</h3>
・ Service development will be limited to Melbourne and Sydney. (Because the number of East Asians is small in other regions, profits cannot be expected)

-After the user logs in, change the display language on the site according to the user's language.

-Set up categories for products so that people in the three countries can easily find them, and let the seller select them. Even if the title is in a different language, it will be easier to identify the desired product from the category and product photo.

・ The seller is asked to select the condition of the product and what kind of transaction he/she wants to make so that it can be communicated to users in other languages. (Since it is intended to be used by people in three countries, avoid making the product description in one of the languages ​​unreadable by people in other countries.)

・ This service not only sells second-hand goods but also exchanges second-hand goods with each other. (This is because many East Asians meet in person to exchange second-hand goods due to the inconvenience of Australian home delivery services.)

-When using the chat function, place a national flag icon next to the user name so that you can tell which country the trading partner is from. This allows you to quickly see in which language the user should speak.

・ Compared to Asia where the delivery service is cheap, the delivery cost is high in Australia and the number of users is small in Asians, so this service does not have a delivery function. Asian people don't use Australia post often in here. The exchange of money for selling second-hand goods is carried out by meeting directly between users when handing over second-hand goods. Therefore, you cannot pay money through this service.

・ There has a priority to display for those who want to sell second-hand goods immediately. It's paid.

-Also, make it possible for users to evaluate sellers so that they can purchase from good sellers.

-Users should stop duplicating accounts as much as possible by associating them with phone numbers.

・ Make a monthly plan so that advertisements will not be displayed.

・ About the main revenue of this service. It is not a traditional system that charges transaction fees to promote transactions between users. There are two main ways to earn money. First, a video ad for about 15 to 30 seconds will be displayed on the loading screen after the setting of the used product is completed. (Ad unit price is higher than normal Adsense). second, Where the traditional Google Adsense ads are pasted, paste the ads of Asian companies operating in Australia. (Because it has the advantage of being able to place ads for certain Asians living in Australia, it is possible to set a higher unit price than usual to companies.)

・ After the start of this service, this monthly plan will be provided free of charge for one month in order to increase the number of users

<h3>Outcome</h3>
If this project is successful, the trading of second-hand goods by East Asians living in Australia will be active. By using web services, transactions between individuals, which used to be done in small group chats, will be noticed by many people, and it will be easier to obtain what you want. It will be easier for second-hand sellers to find people to buy or replace second-hand goods that they have been looking for in small groups. In addition, since we trade second-hand goods, we can reuse resources and reduce garbage. Finally, if the service is successful, it may lead to not only second-hand goods but also EC sites targeting East Asians in Australia.
